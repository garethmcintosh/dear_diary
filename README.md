Created with the help of Chat-GPT 3.5

This is a simple python script that can be used as a digital diary, the diary text is encrypted upon writing
and decrypted upon reading by using a local .key file that the program will generate. This key should not
be shared if you do not want people viewing the contents of your diary.
